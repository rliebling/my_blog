content: "#amazon | How does Amazon \r\n \r\nMany people wonder how Amazon works - one of the largest trading platforms on the Internet. A critical role in the organization of Amazon is played by an automated warehouse system. Everything is arranged in such a way that any employee can find the necessary goods in the shortest possible time. Compliance with the principles of work in the warehouse is being monitored. Control is carried out using modern software. \r\n \r\nAmazon is keeping up with the times and is trying to minimize the human factor in organizing work processes. The system independently monitors orders, finds in the database the location of the goods by number, and the employee can only pick it up from the indicated shelf. \r\n \r\nAmazon monitors the performance of warehouse workers using a feedback system. Each collector has a plan that he must adhere to. For its implementation, the staff has all the conditions, including technical. Therefore, there is no need to worry about the timeliness of sending orders to an Amazon customer. \r\n \r\nhttps://shoplety.blogspot.com/2020/05/amazon.html"
